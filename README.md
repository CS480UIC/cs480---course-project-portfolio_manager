# Database description

The topic for our project is a financial portfolio manager for users in which they will have different features. 
These features will include price averaging of stock bought/loss, different user profiles switching, input capability of history of trades, etc. 
All of these will be databases stored, thus the project will be database heavy with a front end to enable users to interact with the database.
